# GUIDANCE — PREDICTION BETS (HYPE MODE)

## PRIME DIRECTIVE

Prediction Bets is NOT a website.

Prediction Bets is a **culture engine**.

Everything built must prioritize:

1. Tribe identity
2. Participation
3. Viral spread
4. Cultural relevance

Products exist to amplify the community, not the opposite.

If a decision improves technology but weakens culture, culture wins.

---

## CORE MISSION

Create the global epicenter of Prediction Markets.

Prediction Bets must become:

- The place where reality is debated through markets.
- The internet-native tribe of people who predict the future.
- A movement that feels alive, chaotic, intelligent and addictive.

Goal:

**Become the WallStreetBets of Prediction Markets, but native to this new category.**

---

## CULTURAL DNA (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. TRIBE FIRST

Users must feel:

> “I am part of something.”

Prediction Bets is not an audience.

It is a tribe.

Design everything to create:

- Identity
- Belonging
- Status inside the group

---

### 2. US VS THEM ENERGY

Every strong movement has contrast.

Prediction Bets stands against:

- Opinion without skin in the game
- Media narratives without accountability
- Experts who never risk capital
- Prediction without measurable outcomes

Core belief:

**Reality beats opinion. Markets reveal truth.**

---

### 3. CONTROLLED CHAOS

Do NOT over-corporatize the experience.

Prediction Bets must feel:

- Alive
- Internet-native
- Slightly rebellious
- Meme-capable

Avoid:

- Corporate tone
- Academic language
- Overly polished seriousness

Allow:

- Humor
- Irony
- Internal jokes
- Cultural spontaneity

---

## PRIMAL BRANDING (HYPE EXECUTION)

### Creation Story
Prediction Bets was born because forecasting is broken.

People argue endlessly, but markets settle reality.

Prediction Bets organizes collective intelligence into a living system.

---

### Creed
- Reality is measurable.
- Skin in the game matters.
- Consensus emerges from incentives.
- Prediction is participation, not opinion.

---

### Icons
Visual identity must feel:

- Sharp
- Digital-native
- High-signal
- Minimal but bold

Design should look like:

“Built by insiders who understand the future.”

---

### Rituals (CRITICAL FOR HYPE)

Design recurring behaviors:

- Daily prediction battles
- Weekly consensus shifts
- Signal drops
- Public wins and losses
- Community prediction events

Rituals must be visible and repeatable.

---

### Pagans (Opposition)
The tribe defines itself against:

- Talking heads
- Guesswork without risk
- Clickbait forecasting
- Authority without accountability

---

### Sacred Words (TRIBAL LANGUAGE)

Create internal vocabulary users adopt naturally:

- Signal
- Edge
- Consensus
- Reality check
- Market truth
- Prediction mindset

Language must be short, sharp and meme-friendly.

---

### Leader
Prediction Bets is led by:

- Data
- Collective intelligence
- Builders and contributors

Avoid personality cults.

The tribe itself is the leader.

---

## HYPE ARCHITECTURE

### Identity Mechanics
Users must gain identity through:

- Reputation based on accuracy
- Prediction track record
- Visible ranking systems
- Public performance history

Status = accuracy + consistency.

NOT popularity.

---

### Meme Layer (MANDATORY)

Design systems that encourage:

- Screenshots
- Prediction flexing
- Public wins
- Viral sharing

Users should WANT to show:

“I predicted this.”

---

The platform must create:

- Internal heroes (top predictors)

Community drama is fuel.

Make users feel:

“I discovered something smart before everyone else.”

## FINAL RULE (ABSOLUTE)

Before building anything, ask:

1. Does this strengthen tribe identity?
2. Does this increase participation?
3. Does this create shareable moments?
4. Does this make users feel part of a movement?

If not, redesign it.

Prediction Bets is not a platform.

Prediction Bets is a living culture built around reality.
