Let me tell you something that should keep every Wall Street analyst up at night.

Three weeks before the Fed announced its decision, Polymarket had it priced at 87%. Not 50-50 "we're not sure." Not some vague directional lean. **Eighty-seven percent.**

Meanwhile, the "experts" on financial television were still debating whether it would happen at all.

## The Signal Was There. Nobody Was Listening.

This is the fundamental problem with traditional financial analysis: it's theater. A well-dressed person sits behind a desk, says something that sounds smart, and nobody ever checks if they were right.

Prediction markets don't have that luxury. Every opinion costs money. Every position has a price. And every outcome gets settled — publicly, permanently, and without room for "well, what I actually meant was..."

That's not just different. That's **revolutionary.**

## Why This Matters Beyond Trading

Here's what most people miss about prediction markets: they're not just gambling with extra steps. They're the most efficient information aggregation mechanism humans have ever built.

Think about it. A prediction market takes thousands of individual assessments — each backed by real capital — and synthesizes them into a single probability. No committee. No editorial board. No "senior analyst" with a corner office and a track record nobody bothers to verify.

Just signal. Pure, incentive-aligned signal.

## The Uncomfortable Truth

The reason Wall Street is nervous isn't because prediction markets are new. It's because they're **better**. Better at pricing risk. Better at aggregating information. Better at being honest.

And in a world where information is the ultimate currency, being better at honesty is an existential threat to everyone whose business model depends on opacity.

So the next time someone on TV tells you what's going to happen in the economy, ask yourself: what does the market say? Not the stock market — the *prediction* market.

Because reality doesn't care about your credentials. It only cares about your accuracy.

What's your edge?
