Your uncle thinks he knows who's winning the Super Bowl. Your barber has a "lock" pick. The guy at the office who watches three games a year is suddenly an expert because he saw a highlight on Instagram.

None of them have skin in the game.

## The Market Doesn't Care About Your Narrative

Here's what separates prediction markets from sports talk radio: there's no room for hot takes that cost nothing. When a Polymarket contract on the Super Bowl winner shifts from 55 to 72 cents, that's not some talking head "going with their gut." That's thousands of independent actors putting real capital behind real analysis.

Injury reports. Weather models. Historical matchup data. Coaching tendencies. It all gets synthesized into a single number — not by a committee, but by the collective intelligence of people who *lose money* when they're wrong.

That's the difference between a prediction and a performance.

## Why Vegas Isn't Enough Anymore

Don't get me wrong — Vegas is good at what it does. But Vegas lines aren't designed to be accurate. They're designed to balance action. The house wants equal money on both sides so they can collect the vig regardless of the outcome.

Prediction markets have no such incentive. They don't need balanced books. They need **truth**. And when the incentive is truth, the signal is cleaner. Every time.

## The Receipts Don't Lie

Look at the last five Super Bowls. In four of five, the prediction market favorite won outright. The one "miss"? The market had it at 52-48 — essentially a coin flip, which is exactly what that game turned out to be.

Compare that to the ESPN "expert picks" panel, which went 2-for-5 over the same period. Two. Out of five. You'd do better flipping a coin, which is exactly the point.

The next time someone tells you they "just know" who's winning the big game, ask them one question: what do the markets say? Because the market has receipts, and your uncle doesn't.

Game recognize game. Markets recognize reality.
