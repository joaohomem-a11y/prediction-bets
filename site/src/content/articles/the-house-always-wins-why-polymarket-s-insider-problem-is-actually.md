Gordon Gekko was wrong about one thing. Greed isn't good—*information* is good. And right now, that information is flowing through Polymarket like water through a broken dam, creating the kind of price discovery that makes traditional markets look like they're running on Windows 95.

The pearl-clutching has begun. Barron's is worried about "insider trading" on Polymarket, as if information asymmetry is some new phenomenon that didn't exist when your grandfather was trading railroad stocks in 1952. Here's the uncomfortable truth they're dancing around: every market has insiders. The difference is that prediction markets don't pretend otherwise.

Think about it like *The Big Short*. Michael Burry wasn't committing insider trading when he saw the housing bubble—he just did his homework while everyone else was getting drunk on easy money. Polymarket works the same way, except instead of hiding the smart money behind closed doors, it broadcasts every trade in real-time.

**The data doesn't lie, even when people do.**

When French whale "Théo" dropped $45 million on Trump winning the election, the establishment media called it market manipulation. When he turned out to be right, suddenly it was "lucky timing." But here's what the odds movements actually revealed: someone with serious capital was willing to back their conviction with real money while pollsters were still playing statistical gymnastics with "likely voter" models.

That's not insider trading—that's *accountability*. The difference between a prediction market bettor and a cable news pundit? One of them can lose their house if they're wrong.

Traditional markets spend billions on compliance departments trying to prevent information advantages. Prediction markets do the opposite—they *reward* information advantages, creating incentives for people to surface truth faster than any regulatory framework ever could. It's like the difference between Soviet central planning and price signals in a free market.

**This is where it gets interesting.**

Polymarket's "insider problem" is actually solving the biggest issue plaguing modern forecasting: accountability theater. When Nate Silver gives Trump a 30% chance and gets it wrong, what happens? He writes a blog post explaining why the model was actually right. When someone on Polymarket gives Trump 30% and gets it wrong, they lose money. Real money. The kind that pays mortgages.

The platform isn't just aggregating opinions—it's aggregating *financial commitments* to those opinions. And financial commitments, unlike Twitter polls or expert predictions, have a funny way of revealing what people actually believe versus what they say they believe.

Sure, some traders have better information networks than others. Campaign insiders probably know things that random retail traders don't. But that's not a bug—it's the entire point. The fastest way to surface private information is to create a market where that information can be monetized. Every insider trade is essentially a leak with financial verification.

**The real edge isn't the information—it's the honesty.**

While traditional prediction outlets hedge their language with confidence intervals and caveats, Polymarket forces binary outcomes. Either something happens or it doesn't. Either you were right or you were wrong. Either you made money or you lost it.

This isn't your grandfather's stock market, where quarterly earnings can be massaged and guidance can be "adjusted." This is pure, unfiltered reality testing. And reality, as we all learned in 2016, doesn't give a damn about conventional wisdom.

So when Barron's worries about Polymarket's insider advantage, they're missing the forest for the trees. The platform isn't being corrupted by information asymmetry—it's being *powered* by it. Every informed trade makes the market more accurate, not less.

The real question isn't whether insiders are trading on Polymarket. The real question is: why are you still listening to forecasters who don't have skin in the game?
