There's a person in a nice suit sitting in a glass office somewhere right now, charging you 1% of your portfolio annually to "manage" your investments. A significant portion of their "strategy" involves guessing what the Federal Reserve will do next.

Here's the thing: the prediction market already knows. And it doesn't charge you a management fee.

## The Fed Funds Futures Tell the Truth

Between CME FedWatch, Polymarket, and Kalshi, there are now multiple real-money markets pricing Federal Reserve rate decisions with extraordinary precision. We're talking calibration scores that would make Nate Silver weep with joy.

Over the last two years, prediction markets have correctly priced the direction of every single Fed decision — not always the exact magnitude, but the direction and timing with remarkable consistency. Meanwhile, the Wall Street "consensus forecast" has been wrong on timing in 4 of the last 7 decisions.

Four out of seven. Your portfolio manager's multi-million dollar research department performs worse than a market made up of anonymous internet users with Metamask wallets.

## Why the Market Beats the Analysts

It's not that analysts are dumb. Many of them are genuinely brilliant. The problem is structural. Analysts at major banks can't be truly independent because their forecasts affect their firm's trading positions. They can't be genuinely contrarian because it's career suicide to be wrong and alone.

Prediction markets have none of these constraints. Nobody knows who you are. Nobody cares about your career. The only thing that matters is whether you're right. And that structural freedom — combined with the financial incentive to be accurate — produces better forecasts.

It's not magic. It's just better incentives.

## The One Percent Tax on Ignorance

Here's the uncomfortable math: if your portfolio manager charges 1% and their rate predictions underperform a free prediction market, you're paying a 1% annual tax on willful ignorance. You're paying for the suit, the office, the confident handshake — not the accuracy.

The smart money isn't hiring analysts. It's reading markets. The prediction market for the next Fed decision is live right now, updated every second, and it costs you nothing to look at it.

So the next time your financial advisor says "I think the Fed will..." — stop them. Pull up the market. Show them the price. And ask them what information they have that thousands of financially motivated traders don't.

The silence will be worth more than their annual fee.

Reality doesn't charge a management fee. Why should your access to it?
